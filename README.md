# Drowsiness-Detection

## Our problem :

Drowsy driving, a serious hazard often resulting from insufficient rest, causes drivers
to lose focus, react more slowly, and even experience brief micro-sleeps. This issue has
devastating impacts, contributing to approximately 328,000 accidents, 109,000 injuries, and
6,400 fatalities annually (Bankrate[1]). Unlike the effects of alcohol or drugs, drowsiness
is harder to detect, creating a challenge for preventive measures. A 2019 AAA Foundation
 study reveals that while 96% of drivers recognize the extreme risk of drowsy driving,
only 29% feel that they are at risk of getting pulled over by law enforcement.

## Our objective :

Develop a machine-learning-powered system that monitors driver fatigue in real-time. 
This model will focus directly on the driverâ€™s condition by analyzing eye and mouth states and deduce 
if the driver is in a tired state accurately.
